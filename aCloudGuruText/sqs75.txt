whichis going to cover the SQS or simple queue service
and SQS is actually the first AWS service that was publicly avaiable, 
so thisis one of the oldest services what they have 
but u only need to know about it as a very high level.
So what is SQS?? whatis the basiclly a messages queue service. 
So it give u access to the message queue.
whcih can be used to store messages while waiting an application or a computer
to process them. so it enables webservice applications to quickly and reliably
queue messages that one component in the application generates
for another component to consume. 
so what do we mean when we say a queue
so a queue is a temporary repository for messages which are waitting 
processing. 
a sound like a bit abstract, dont worry 
because its a easiest way to understand it
is if I show u a couple of examples. 
so my first example its a meme website.
so here's our user, so they wanto upload an image whichis going to turn to 
a meme. So here's a picture of me and Ryan at the ACS office in London
So the photo is goign to be uploaded to a website and our website
is going to store the photo in an S3 bucket. 
So once the photo is uploaded to S3 that is going to trigger lambda function
and the lambda function isgoing to send all the data associated with this images 
into SQS. So this data might include the words that we wanto add to the photo, 
maybe the color of the texts.
The position on the photo where we want to display the texts, 
maybe the name of the S3 bucket that its stored and maybe the name of 
user who owns the image.
